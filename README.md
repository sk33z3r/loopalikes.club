# Loopalikes

Initially I made a script that grabbed all the Loophead variation pictures from the first drop, and made animated gifs in various ways. Then the community in Discord started making connections between the Loopheads and random characters and celebrities. So, I took upon myself to make something fun for everyone to enjoy, instead of trying to dig through weeks worth of Discord chats to see what the community has come up with!

## What's Here?

Only a few small things:

* Showcase of all the Loophead faces from each drop in one page.
* Funny lookalikes between the Loopheads and characters known as "Looplegangers."
* Origin stories that some members of the community have written for their Loopheads.

## What's Coming?

Give me ideas! I already plan on adding some of these:

* Guide page, with useful links to Reddit and Loopring official articles on what to do with the Loopheads and how they work.
* Showcase of each face, with all 10 colors in a grouping.
* Page of well laid out gifs for each loophead.
