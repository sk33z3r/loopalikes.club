# Loopalikes

Initially I made a script that grabbed all the Loophead variation pictures from the first drop, and made animated gifs in various ways. Then the community in Discord started making connections between the Loopheads and random characters and celebrities. So, I took upon myself to make something fun for everyone to enjoy, instead of trying to dig through weeks worth of Discord chats to see what the community has come up with!

## What's Here?

### Things to browse

* Showcase of all the Loophead faces from each drop in one page.
* Showcase of each face, with all 10 colors in a grouping.
* Funny lookalikes between the Loopheads and characters known as "Looplegangers."
* Origin stories that some members of the community have written for their Loopheads.
* Guide page, with useful links to Reddit and Loopring official articles on what to do with the Loopheads and how they work.

### Hidden features

* _Anytime_ a loophead is displayed, the site randomly picks a brain+background. Refresh to see different ones!
* Click a Loopleganger name/ID to get more info on the matched pop-culture figure.

## What's Coming?

Give me ideas! I already plan on adding these:

* Page of well laid out gifs for each loophead.
