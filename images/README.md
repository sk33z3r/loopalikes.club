# Automatic GIF Generation

The `gen_gif.sh` script does a few simple things:

1. Download all variations of each released loophead.
2. Resize them to 900 x 900.
3. Create 5 "throbbing brain" gifs, one for each background.
4. Create a "showcase" gif that runs through all variations in sequence.
5. Create a "random" gif that runs through all variations in a random order.

You can also create a full collection showcase where it picks 1 random image from each loophead and creates a gif either in sequence or randomly.
